## 📋 What To Do

### Option 1: Wait for Build to Complete (Recommended)

The build is running. Just wait for it to finish:

1. **Check progress** (run in PowerShell):
   ```powershell
   .\check-status.ps1
   ```

2. **Once complete**, verify services:
   ```powershell
   docker compose ps
   ```

3. **Access the application**:
   - API: http://localhost:8000/docs
   - Dashboard: http://localhost:8501

### Option 2: Monitor Build in Real-Time

Open a **new PowerShell window** and run:
```powershell
cd D:\Python\kidsmart-plus
docker compose build
```

This will show live progress.

### Option 3: Let It Build in Background

The build is already running. You can:
- Close the terminal (build continues)
- Come back later and check status with `.\check-status.ps1`
- Start services when ready: `docker compose up -d`

---

## 🎯 Next Steps (After Build Completes)

1. **Start services** (if not auto-started):
   ```powershell
   docker compose up -d
   ```

2. **Check status**:
   ```powershell
   docker compose ps
   ```
   
   Should show 6 running containers:
   - kidsmart-plus-api-1
   - kidsmart-plus-worker-1
   - kidsmart-plus-dashboard-1
   - kidsmart-plus-beat-1
   - kidsmart-plus-db-1
   - kidsmart-plus-redis-1

3. **View logs** (optional):
   ```powershell
   docker compose logs -f api
   ```

4. **Access the application**:
   - API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs
   - Dashboard: http://localhost:8501

---

## 🆘 If Build Fails

If the build fails or times out:

1. **Use the rebuild script**:
   ```powershell
   .\rebuild.ps1
   ```

2. **Or check troubleshooting docs**:
   - Timeout issues: `DOCKER_BUILD_FIXES.md`
   - Image conflicts: `DOCKER_IMAGE_CONFLICT_FIX.md`

---

## 📊 Expected Build Output

When complete, you should see:
```
[+] Building 900-1200s (18/18) FINISHED
[+] Running 6/6

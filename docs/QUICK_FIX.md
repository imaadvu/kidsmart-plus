# 🚨 QUICK FIX - AWS Deployment Issues

## Your Errors:
1. ❌ `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'api.cache'`
2. ❌ `bcrypt version error`
3. ❌ `password cannot be longer than 72 bytes`

## ✅ All Fixed! Here's what changed:

### Files Modified:
- `requirements-base.txt` → Added `bcrypt==4.0.1`
- `requirements.txt` → Added `bcrypt==4.0.1`
- `scripts/start_api.py` → Auto-truncates password to 72 bytes

### Files Created:
- `AWS_DEPLOYMENT.md` → Complete deployment guide
- `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` → Step-by-step checklist
- `verify_deployment.py` → Pre-deployment verification
- `deploy-aws.sh` → Automated deployment (Linux/Mac)
- `deploy-aws.bat` → Automated deployment (Windows)

## 🚀 DEPLOY NOW (Copy-Paste This)

### On Your Local Machine:
```bash
# Verify everything is ready
python verify_deployment.py

# Upload ALL files to AWS server (use SCP, SFTP, or your method)
# Make sure api/cache.py is included!
```

### On Your AWS Server:
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /path/to/kidsmart-plus/

# Stop everything
docker compose down --rmi all --volumes

# Clean Docker cache
docker builder prune -f

# Build fresh (this will include api/cache.py and new bcrypt)
docker compose build --no-cache

# Start services
docker compose up -d

# Watch logs
docker compose logs -f api
```

---

## ✅ Verification (Run on AWS after deployment)

```bash
# 1. Check all services are running
docker compose ps

# 2. Verify api.cache module loads
docker compose exec api python -c "from api.cache import cache; print('✓ OK')"

# 3. Verify bcrypt version
docker compose exec api python -c "import bcrypt; print(bcrypt.__version__)"

# 4. Test API
curl http://localhost:8000/docs
```

## 🎯 Expected Results:

When successful, you should see in logs:
```
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Context impl PostgresqlImpl.
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Will assume transactional DDL.
Seeded demo data
Created admin user from env
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

**NO MORE:**
- ❌ `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'api.cache'`
- ❌ `bcrypt version error`
- ❌ `password cannot be longer than 72 bytes`

---

## 📁 Make Sure These Files Are on AWS:

Critical files that MUST be on your server:
- ✅ `api/cache.py` (THIS WAS MISSING!)
- ✅ `api/main.py`
- ✅ `requirements-base.txt` (with bcrypt==4.0.1)
- ✅ `scripts/start_api.py` (with password truncation)
- ✅ `docker-compose.yml`
- ✅ `Dockerfile`
- ✅ `.env` (with your credentials)

---

## 🆘 Still Having Issues?

```bash
# Full nuclear option - complete rebuild
docker compose down --rmi all --volumes
docker system prune -af
docker volume prune -f
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs -f api
```

Read these for complete details:
- `AWS_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Complete deployment guide
- `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` - Step-by-step checklist
- `README.md` - Project overview

---

**Remember:** After uploading files to AWS, you MUST rebuild the Docker image!

```bash
docker compose build --no-cache
```

This ensures all new files (like api/cache.py) are included in the image.
